    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This report covers my statistical analysis of the open data shared by [DonorsChoose.org](https://www.donorschoose.org), regarding project funding success rate by subject. It details:\n",
    "* why I examined DonorsChoose open data\n",
    "* how I went about acquiring, cleaning, and preparing the data for processing\n",
    "* the statistical methods I used to produce results\n",
    "* analysis of the implications of said results\n",
    "* all resources used in conducting this project\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to providing some insight into which projects attract donations and how DonorsChoose project managers might be able to revise their tactics towards increase funding success, a goal of this project is to provide transparency regarding the data science applied, to allow ease of understanding, sharing, and scaling for additional feedback, correction, and follow-on work by others.\n",

    "### About this work\n",
    "I was inspired to start this research because my wife is a public school teacher who often funds her classroom projects, unreimbursed, from our personal savings. I was aware of DonorsChoose due to its high publicity profile, as it is often promoted by celebrities such as [Stephen Colbert](https://youtu.be/I4GMX0MJNYw) (a DonorsChoose board member, not coincidentally). I thought I might be able to learn tips and tricks to help Nicole, my wife, build a DonorsChoose page for her next unfunded project idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "This self-serving inclination is not unique to Nicole's classroom and our personal finances, however. The New York Times [reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/us/teachers-school-supplies.html) that 94 percent of  public school teachers fund their classroom projects out-of-pocket at an average rate of $479 annually. Seven percent report spending over $1000 of their own money on their classrooms to fill budget gaps not met by the stipends allocated by their school districts (Chokshi). DonorsChoose has grown incredibly for years, and is now providing millions of dollars yearly to public school funding from private donations from over three million donors reaching over 30 million students by over one million projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "This work could be the first step in providing insight and advice to help teachers attract classroom funding using DonorsChoose. With such findings, guidelines about how to structure project proposals could be used to increase funding success. However, in researching this project, I decided that whether it is a fair idea to help teachers fund their classrooms using DonorsChoose is a valid, debated question that demands additional consideration and research, as covered in the [Discussion](#discussion), below."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### About DonorsChoose\n",
    "\n",
    "[DonorsChoose](https:www.donorschoose.org) is a crowd-sourced nonprofit organization that provides a platform for teachers to request funding for classroom supplies and projects. Donors can then peruse the advertised projects on the site, to choose which causes to support based on information garnered from the page created for each plea by the teacher or class. These \"attractor\" pages are standardized, containing uniform components such as classroom data, category of project, essays or short-form paragraphs. These page components cover how funds will be used, the financial targets, provide a status bar showing progress towards goal, and more. DonorsChoose has made public many years of its project data, tracking these attributes and donation results over many years. \n",
    "\n",
    "DonorsChoose has made [thirteen years of its data](https://data.donorschoose.org/docs/overview/) open and publicly accessible for analysis. The data includes information about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Projects (including classroom projects that have been posted, school information such as government-issued NCES ID, lat/long, and city/state/zip)\n",
    "* Donations (including donation amounts, donor city, state)\n",
    "* Project resources (including materials/resources requested for the classroom projects, including vendor name)\n",
    "* Project essays (including the full text of the teacher-written requests accompanying all classroom projects)\n",
    "* Giving pages (number of teachers, students, amount raised)\n"

    "\n",
    "In addition to raw data, DonorChoose also makes available filtered data access through an [exploration/visualization portal](https://data.donorschoose.org/explore-our-impact/) served by [Looker](https://looker.com/). To use it, any browser seems to be able to log in with credentials (login: “opendata@donorschoose.org” / “teachersrock1”) then interact and run queries to see results about specific locations, schools, years, and so on. This is an interesting and useful way to examine trends and results regarding projects and funding, and each visualization can be downloaded as Acrobat PDF with  its filtered, preprocessed underlying data availalble as a standard CSV file.\n",

Essentially, a user can explore all the projects that successfully received funding but none of the projects that did not. In the underlying source data .gz archive, however, both successful and unsuccessful projects are provided."

    "### Related Work\n",
    "\n",
    "I could not find other work in the area of analyzing funding completion rate, though there is existing (and substantially more rigorous) [research completed](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/donors-www15.pdf) by Althoff and Leskovec from Stanford, specific to analyzing this dataset regarding Donor Retention rate. This research found that teachers were not particularly successful at retaining donors: \"Instead, they are most successful in retaining donors in their first projects. After those, the return rates are monotonically decreasing over time. However, we see that the effect levels off for site donors whereas the retention continues to decrease for teacher-referred donors. This could be explained by viewing teacher-referred donors as a limited resource available to the teacher. Teachers are only able to receive a certain amount of donors from their personal support network. This support is limited and asking over and over again for new projects is less and\n",
    "less likely to be successful as the teacher “drained” most of the resources available to them already\" (Althoff, 6). This would seem to make valuable determining if/how a teacher might be able to construct a project description page that could be most successful upon first attempt.  Examining at features of projects that correlate to successful funding might be a worthwhile addition to the mix, to add to the research about how teachers retain donors over time. So, that's what I decided to analyze."

    "DonorsChoose provides guidelines to access their available data. By reading through these guidelines, I did learn much about structure of the dataset, and issues within such as \"A few years back, donor addresses became optional, even when the donor is eligible to receive a mailed thank-you packet from the classroom. So there are a lot of null address fields for donors who elected not to provide their address.\" ([OpenData Layout and Docs page](https://research.donorschoose.org/t/opedata-layout-and-docs/18)). \n",

    "The fields and schema of each data file is covered, including the schema of the project data which I was focused on. DonorsChoose Data provides guidance to join and query these files using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). However, after downloading, installing and attempting a variety of configuration approaches, I did not pursue this path as I was not able to learn enough about PostgreSQL to be able to run join or query scripts. As I indicated in my verbal presentation about this report, perhaps I shall try again after I complete DATA 514 (Data Management) during the Winter 2018 quarter. \n",

The most significant findings would likely be represented by smaller P values, though if I want to rank I'll likely go with a sort of the Pearson's correlations calculated above."

    "The DonorsChoose approach to funding education expenses is a valuable alternative for teachers who often must use personal funds to equip their classrooms or to enable novel learning experiences. Helping teachers understand the effectiveness or shortcomings of various options in setting up, describing, and categorizing their projects might increase the rates of donation. Though, it might instead produce a \"zero-sum\" competitive result, where some teachers attract even more donations, causing others who are less informed or adept with DonorsChoose to go without. \n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By looking at either measure, Pearson's correlation coefficient or the significance of p-values of a logistic regression, it is clear that some subjects are associated with funding success while others are associated with failure. This answers the research question about which features available in the raw, unfiltered DonorsChoose project data would be correlated to project funding success or failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "With such information, teachers could consider categorizing their projects differently in pursuit of greater funding liklihood. For example, if a teacher wanted soccer balls, they could choose to categorize the project as \"Team Sports\" rather than \"Gym & Fitness\" and possibly increase their liklihood of funding. However, in doing this research, and when reading about reservations some have about crowdfunding classroom budgets, perhaps more work should be done before disseminating any such \"advice.\"\n",
