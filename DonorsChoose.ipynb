    "\n",
    "This report covers my statistical analysis of the open data shared by DonorsChoose.org, regardsing project funding success rate by subject. It details:\n",
    "* why I examined DonorsChoose open data\n",
    "* how I went about acquiring, cleaning, and preparing the data for processing\n",
    "* the statistical methods I used to produce results\n",
    "* analysis of the implications of said results\n",
    "* all resources used in conducting this project\n",
    "In addition to providing some insight into which projects attract donations and how DonorsChoose project managers might be able to revise their tactics towards increase funding success, a goal of this project is to provide transparency regarding the data science applied, to allow ease of understanding, sharing, and scaling for additional feedback, correction, and follow-on work by others."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "[DonorsChoose](https:www.donorschoose.org) is a crowd-sourced nonprofit organization that provides a platform for teachers to request funding for classroom supplies and projects. Donors can then peruse the advertised projects on the site, to choose which causes to support based on information garnered from the page created for each plea by the teacher or class. These \"attractor\" pages are standardized, containing uniform components such as classroom data, category of project, essays or short-form paragraphs. These page components cover how funds will be used, the financial targets, provide a status bar showing progress towards goal, and more. DonorsChoose has made public many years of its project data, tracking these attributes and donation results over many years. This project statistically analyzes part of the DonorsChoose public dataset to identify the project subjects that result in more (or less) effective project funding requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "I intend to explore the data to find correlations (or lack thereof) in areas such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do specific project types garner more funding than others?\n",
    "2. Do specific class locations garner more funding than others?\n",
    "3. Do specific giving page traits (such as \"Thank you notes sent\") garner more funding than others?\n",
    "\n",
    "I expect that these questions and related ones will support traditions linear regression modelling and plotting, where I hope to be able to identify variables that have shown to be particularly successful or unsuccessful at attracting donations to projects. For example, given that a giving page must use pre-defined categories for primary_focus_subject (e.g. \"Environmental Science\"), some subjects might be better-funded than others. Perhaps certain donor regions (such as the Seattle area or San Francisco area) might support particular subjects (\"Computer Science\"), while others regions (such as Iowa from which I write this project plan) might better support different subjects (\"Agricultural Science\")."

    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "I expect to use [Python]() in a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) to load and explore the data. I will use standard statistical anayses to investigate my research questions, perhaps develop new ideas, and report meaningful correlations between project variables and outcomes. For example, I should be able to find and plot which subject results in funding success, or whether the proposed cost of a project produces significantly different success rates. (Should a teacher create one project for all gaps in Art for $1000 or a collection of $200 projects, in order to reach the same financial end?) The deliverable should be one IPYNB file, its supporting data CSV files, and any PNG files corresponding to generated visualizations, in a [Github](https://github.com/) repository parallel to this one. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sourcess\n",
    "\n",
    "DonorsChoose has made [thirteen years of its data](https://data.donorschoose.org/docs/overview/) open and publicly accessible for analysis. The data includes information that I have downloaded and begun analysis on:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Projects (including classroom projects that have been posted, school information such as government-issued NCES ID, lat/long, and city/state/zip)\n",
    "* Donations (including donation amounts, donor city, state)\n",
    "* Project resources (including materials/resources requested for the classroom projects, including vendor name)\n",
    "* Project essays (including the full text of the teacher-written requests accompanying all classroom projects)\n",
    "* Giving pages (number of teachers, students, amount raised)\n",
    "\n",
    "and more, such as gift card data, which I do not intend to use in my analysis.\n"

    "\n",
    "I want to do this project to learn how teachers could improve the effectiveness of their crowdfunding efforts. I hope that trends and correlations can be shown that might help teachers attract more donations by creating their funding pages using the options and tactics that are associated with higher rates of project completion or higher rates of donation. I could share this information to teaching communities or discussion groups for feedback, which might help others better use crowdfunding through DonorsChoose to meet their classroom expense needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The DonorsChoose approach to funding education expenses is a valuable alternative for teachers who often must use personal funds to equip their classrooms or to enable novel learning experiences. Helping teachers understand the effectiveness or shortcomings of various options in setting up, describing, and categorizing their projects might increase the rates of donation. Though, it might instead produce a \"zero-sum\" competitive result, where some teachers attract even more donations, causing others who are less informed or adept with DonorsChoose to go without. Finally, my motivations are not purely altruistic as first, I intend to share my analysis with my underfunded high school-teaching wife who often funds her ideas and classrooms from our savings, typically without reimbursement from her school district. \"Charity begins at home...\" (Browne, 141).\n"
