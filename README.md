## Assignment 6: Donors' Choices

This repository contains my final project report for University of Washington's Fall 2018 DATA 512 course ([course wiki](https://wiki.communitydata.cc/Human_Centered_Data_Science_(Fall_2018))), instructed by Jonathan Morgan and Os Keyes.

### Summary

My project statistically analyzed the publicly available project data from [DonorsChoose.org](https://www.donorschoose.org/), specifically looking for correlation between project subjects and funding success, or lack thereof. DonorsChoose makes easily accessible many statistics and visualizations showing project funding success, but since about 1/3 of project fail to get funded and "expire," I wanted to learn whether there were trends in which types of projects fail more often. My hypothesis is broadly that some subjects are positively correlated with funding success and others are negatively correlated. I want to show which subjects are so correlated.

Given this information, I think that advice or recommendations could be formed that might help teachers define their project pages to attract more donors and achieve funding completion. In my project report, I cover my findings, as well as ramifications and opportunities for follow-on work.
